Dataset 1
	Two tree searches are performed, with NNIs and SPRs respectively.
	The resulting tree is the best (shortest) of both.

	Before NNI:     tree length is 1.10664142
	NNI      1: new tree length is 1.10141033
	NNI      2: new tree length is 1.09736831
	NNI      3: new tree length is 1.09534730
	NNI      4: new tree length is 1.09385130
	NNI      5: new tree length is 1.09284114
	Performed 5 NNI(s).

	Before SPR:     tree length is 1.10664142
	SPR      1: new tree length is 1.10141033
	SPR      2: new tree length is 1.09534730
	SPR      3: new tree length is 1.09385130
	SPR      4: new tree length is 1.09284114
	Performed 4 SPR(s).

	Explained variance : 0.74308995
